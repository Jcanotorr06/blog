Pretty much everything is available on the internet, and Google is one of the main ways people search for information.

And while you might think it's obvious, many internet users don't know how to use Google search **efficiently** and **effectively**.

In truth, Googling is an art.

To get the right answers, you need to ask the right questions. And to get the right answers quickly, you must know how to ask the right questions.

Everyone should learn the how part, and that's what this tutorial is all about. Below are some helpful tips and tricks you can use to find correct answers to your questions **effectively** and **efficiently**.

## How to Search Google Effectively

### 1. Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match

Generally, when we do a regular search on Google, it makes a shallow search. This may result in pages that may or may not contain all the words you mentioned in your search query.

But if you wrap your search query or question (either a term or a phrase) in quotes like this: `"your question goes here"` then Google will do a deep search. This means that all the results will include pages that contain all the terms in your question that you put within quotes.

This is helpful when you absolutely want a particular term or phrase to be there in your search results.

### 2. Search within a specific site with `site:`

If you want Google to return results from within a particular website, just add `site`: before the question you are searching.

This is also helpful when you want to search for something within a website that doesn't have an internal search option or perhaps doesn't have a very effective one.

For example, searching for site:reddit.com react will populate search results only from the [www.reddit.com](www.reddit.com) website on the topic of React.

### 3. Exclude a term from search results with `-`

If you don't want a term or phrase to appear in your search results, then just add `-` in front of that word.

For e.g. a search on => how to write components in React -class will return all the search results that don't have the term "class" in them. So, (if you know a bit of React) it'll give you only ways to write functional components in React.

### 4. Search images of a particular size with `imagesize:`

If you want to search images of a particular size, then use the tag `imagesize:` in your search query along with the width and height in pixels.

Dimension should be in pixels only â€“ for example, `imagesize:500x500` will populate image results which have a dimension of 500px x 500px. So a search on => "cute dog images imagesize:500x600" (coz why not) will result in pictures of cute dogs with an image size of `500px x 600px`.

### 5. Search for a particular filetype with `filetype:`

If you want to get search results that contain a particular file type such as PDF or PPT, then add `filetype:<extension>` (without the angular brackets). For example, react tutorial filetype:pdf will generate results that contains PDF in them, as seen in the following image:

### 6. Use wildcard `*` to make searches

If you are unsure about or have forgotten any term in your search query/ question, then use the wildcard `*` charachter. Google will replace it for you with relevant terms.

For example, a search on `the * of money` will populate the following results. It will be a bunch of pages that include the phrase such as "the exchange of money", "the use of money", "the role of money", "the psychology of money", and so on.

### 7. Combine searches with ``OR``, ``AND`` logic

If you want your search results to contain two terms, then put the ``AND`` keyword in between them. For example, the search on ``React AND Angular`` will fetch results that have both the terms react and angular in it.

Similarly, if you want either of the terms in your search results, then use the ``OR`` keyword in between them. For example, the search on ``React OR Angular`` will fetch results that have either of the terms or even both.

### 8. Filter out searches with ``AFTER:``, ``BEFORE:`` or ``..`` between two numbers

If you want Google to populate search results that were published after a particular year, then use the tag ``AFTER:``. For example, the search on ``React tutorials AFTER:2020`` will populate search results published after 2020.

Similarly adding the tag ``BEFORE:`` will return results published before a particular year.

You can also search for results published in a certain year range, or for that matter between any numbers. Just add ``..`` between the two numbers you want to search between along with the units, if any.

### 9. Check out related websites using ``related:``

If you want to know what all other websites are available on the internet that are similar to a particular website, then use the ``related:``tag.

For example, a search on ``related:google.com``m will fetch all the websites that are similar to Google like Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and so on.
