The morning of March 12th, 2024, [Cognition](https://www.cognition-labs.com), a recently formed AI startup backed by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and tech industry leaders including former Twitter executive Elad Gil and Doordash co-founder Tony Xu, [announced a fully autonomus AI software engineer called "Devin"](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000).

While there are mutliple coding assistants, ranging from the likes of [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to [JetBrains AI](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/), Devin is said to stand out from the crowd with it's ability to handle the entire development process from start to finish, including the ability to write the code, test it and fixing the bugs that arise.

The announcement of Devin marks a significant shift in the AI-assisted development space, giving engineers a full-fledged AI co-worker, rather than a copilot that could only assist with suggestions or code completions. This announcement has sparked a lot of conversation in the developer community, with many developers expressing their concerns about the potential impact of Devin on the job market.

## But, what exactly can Devin do?

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants like Github’s Copilot, which provide suggestions and code snippets, Devin operates on a completely different level. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Independent project execution**: Give Devin a clear objective, like “build an e-commerce platform,” and it can handle the entire process. It writes clean code, identifies and fixes bugs, and even deploys the finished product.
- **Long term reasoning and planning**: Devin reportedly possesses inpresive planning abilities, allowing it to execute complex engineering tasks requiring thousands of decisions.
- **Self-learning and improvement**: Devin is said to be able to learn from its experiences, continuously improving its performance and skills over time. It can also learn entirely new technologies, allowing it to adapt to new environments and requirements.
- **Bug fixing**: Devin can autonomously identify and fix bugs in codebases, regardless of whether it wrote the code or not.

## Will Devin take my job?

Devin's arrival has sparked a lot of conversation across the tech industry. While it holds the potential to revolutionize various aspects of software development, impacting businesses, developers and even users, it also raises concerns about the future of software engineering jobs.

Personally, I wouldn't be too worried about getting replaced by Devin, at least not for now. While it seems like a significant leap in AI development, it's important to remember that Devin is still in its early stages and this announcement is more of a proof of concept looking to attract investors and potential customers, rather than a fully fledged product ready to take over the world. It's also worth considering that, while Devin can handle the entire development process, it's not a replacement for the creativity, intuition and problem-solving skills that human developers bring to the table.

I believe that Devin will be a valuable tool for the modern developer, closer to what Google is for a writer or a calculator is for a mathematician, allowing us to focus on more complex and creative tasks that require the human touch, while Devin takes care of the more repetitive and mundane tasks. There may be a shift in the job market, but I believe that it will be more of a transformation than a replacement, or who knows, maybe I'm just being optimistic.
